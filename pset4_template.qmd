**PS4:** Due Sat Nov 2 at 5:00PM Central. Worth 100 points. 
We use (`*`) to indicate a problem that we think might be time consuming. 
    
## Style Points (10 pts) 
Please refer to the minilesson on code style
**[here](https://uchicago.zoom.us/rec/share/pG_wQ-pHTQrJTmqNn4rcrw5V194M2H2s-2jdy8oVhWHkd_yZt9o162IWurpA-fxU.BIQlSgZLRYctvzp-)**.

## Submission Steps (10 pts)
1. This problem set is a paired problem set.
2. Play paper, scissors, rock to determine who goes first. Call that person *Partner 1*.
    - Partner 1 (name and cnet ID):
    - Partner 2 (name and cnet ID):
3. Partner 1 will accept the `ps4` and then share the link it creates with their partner. You can only share it with one partner so you will not be able to change it after your partner has accepted. 
4. "This submission is our work alone and complies with the 30538 integrity policy." Add your initials to indicate your agreement: \*\*\_\_\*\* \*\*\_\_\*\*
5. "I have uploaded the names of anyone else other than my partner and I worked with on the problem set **[here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/185usrCREQaUbvAXpWhChkjghdGgmAZXA3lPWpXLLsts/edit)**"  (1 point)
6. Late coins used this pset: \*\*\_\_\*\* Late coins left after submission: \*\*\_\_\*\*
7. Knit your `ps4.qmd` to an PDF file to make `ps4.pdf`, 
    * The PDF should not be more than 25 pages. Use `head()` and re-size figures when appropriate. 
8. (Partner 1): push  `ps4.qmd` and `ps4.pdf` to your github repo.
9. (Partner 1): submit `ps4.pdf` via Gradescope. Add your partner on Gradescope.
10. (Partner 1): tag your submission in Gradescope

**Important:** Repositories are for tracking code. **Do not commit the data or shapefiles to your repo.** The best way to do this is with `.gitignore`, which we have covered in class. If you do accidentally commit the data, Github has a [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github#removing-files-from-a-repositorys-history). The best course of action depends on whether you have pushed yet. This also means that both partners will have to download the initial raw data and any data cleaning code will need to be re-run on both partners' computers.

## Identify hospital closures in POS file (15 pts) (*)

1. Create a list of all hospitals that were active in 2016 that were suspected to have closed by 2019. Record the facility name and zip of each hospital as well as the year of suspected closure. How many hospitals fit in this definition?

filter for hospitals that appear in 2016 as active (Termination code should be active provider) and then check if they disappear from the data

so if termination code == 00, active provider
if 01 then voluntary merger or closure, so maybe pull out datasets where code == 0 and set in four datasets by year then compare fac_nam? 

use if/else loops, to fill a dataframe with hospitals active in 2016 but terminated either in 2017, 2018, or 2019 along with facility name, zip code, and year terminated

```{python}
#filter for a dataset of active hospitals in 2016
active_2016 = df_health[(df_health['PGM_TRMNTN_CD'] == 0) & (df_health['Year'] == 2016)]

active_2017 = df_health[(df_health['PGM_TRMNTN_CD'] == 0) & (df_health['Year'] == 2017)]

active_2018 = df_health[(df_health['PGM_TRMNTN_CD'] == 0) & (df_health['Year'] == 2018)]

active_2019 = df_health[(df_health['PGM_TRMNTN_CD'] == 0) & (df_health['Year'] == 2019)]

```

2. Sort this list of hospitals by name and report the names and year of suspected closure for the first 10 rows.


3. Not all closures are true closures, remove any suspected closures that are zipcodes where the number does not decrease in the year after the suspected closure.

    a. Among the suspected closures, how many hospitals fit this definition? After correcting, how many do you have left?

    b. Sort this list of corrected hospital closures by name and report the first ten rows.
