**PS4:** Due Sat Nov 2 at 5:00PM Central. Worth 100 points. 
We use (`*`) to indicate a problem that we think might be time consuming. 
    
## Style Points (10 pts) 
Please refer to the minilesson on code style
**[here](https://uchicago.zoom.us/rec/share/pG_wQ-pHTQrJTmqNn4rcrw5V194M2H2s-2jdy8oVhWHkd_yZt9o162IWurpA-fxU.BIQlSgZLRYctvzp-)**.

## Submission Steps (10 pts)
1. This problem set is a paired problem set.
2. Play paper, scissors, rock to determine who goes first. Call that person *Partner 1*.
    - Partner 1 (name and cnet ID):
    - Partner 2 (name and cnet ID):
3. Partner 1 will accept the `ps4` and then share the link it creates with their partner. You can only share it with one partner so you will not be able to change it after your partner has accepted. 
4. "This submission is our work alone and complies with the 30538 integrity policy." Add your initials to indicate your agreement: \*\*\_\_\*\* \*\*\_\_\*\*
5. "I have uploaded the names of anyone else other than my partner and I worked with on the problem set **[here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/185usrCREQaUbvAXpWhChkjghdGgmAZXA3lPWpXLLsts/edit)**"  (1 point)
6. Late coins used this pset: \*\*\_\_\*\* Late coins left after submission: \*\*\_\_\*\*
7. Knit your `ps4.qmd` to an PDF file to make `ps4.pdf`, 
    * The PDF should not be more than 25 pages. Use `head()` and re-size figures when appropriate. 
8. (Partner 1): push  `ps4.qmd` and `ps4.pdf` to your github repo.
9. (Partner 1): submit `ps4.pdf` via Gradescope. Add your partner on Gradescope.
10. (Partner 1): tag your submission in Gradescope

**Important:** Repositories are for tracking code. **Do not commit the data or shapefiles to your repo.** The best way to do this is with `.gitignore`, which we have covered in class. If you do accidentally commit the data, Github has a [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github#removing-files-from-a-repositorys-history). The best course of action depends on whether you have pushed yet. This also means that both partners will have to download the initial raw data and any data cleaning code will need to be re-run on both partners' computers.

## Identify hospital closures in POS file (15 pts) (*)

1. Create a list of all hospitals that were active in 2016 that were suspected to have closed by 2019. Record the facility name and zip of each hospital as well as the year of suspected closure. How many hospitals fit in this definition?

3,303 hospitals fit this definition, out of 29085 total hospitals.

```{python}
active_2016 = df_health[(df_health['PGM_TRMNTN_CD'] == 0) & (df_health['Year'] == 2016)]

def find_suspected_closures(active_2016, df_health):
    suspected_closures = pd.DataFrame(columns=['FAC_NAME', 'ZIP_CD', 'Year'])
    
    for index, row in active_2016.iterrows():
        FAC_NAME = row['FAC_NAME']
        ZIP_CD = row['ZIP_CD']
        found = False  
        for Year in range(2017, 2020):
            closed_check = df_health[(df_health['FAC_NAME'] == FAC_NAME) & (df_health['Year'] == Year)]  
            if not closed_check.empty and closed_check['PGM_TRMNTN_CD'].values[0] != 0:
                new_entry = pd.DataFrame({
                    'FAC_NAME': [FAC_NAME],
                    'ZIP_CD': [ZIP_CD],
                    'Year': [Year]
                })
                suspected_closures = pd.concat([suspected_closures, new_entry], ignore_index=True)
                found = True 

        if not found:
            for Year in range(2017, 2020):
                new_entry = pd.DataFrame({
                    'FAC_NAME': [FAC_NAME],
                    'ZIP_CD': [ZIP_CD],
                    'Year': [Year]
                })
                suspected_closures = pd.concat([suspected_closures, new_entry], ignore_index=True)

    return suspected_closures

suspected_closures = find_suspected_closures(active_2016, df_health)
print(len(suspected_closures.loc[suspected_closures.groupby('FAC_NAME')['Year'].idxmin()]))
```


2. Sort this list of hospitals by name and report the names and year of suspected closure for the first 10 rows.

```{python}
print(suspected_closures.loc[suspected_closures.groupby('FAC_NAME')['Year'].idxmin()].head(10))
suspected_closures_dirt = suspected_closures.loc[suspected_closures.groupby('FAC_NAME')['Year'].idxmin()]
```

3. Not all closures are true closures, remove any suspected closures that are zipcodes where the number does not decrease in the year after the suspected closure.

    a. Among the suspected closures, how many hospitals fit this definition? After correcting, how many do you have left?

    Working with the definition given, we have 7 mergers/acquisitions.

```{python}
import pandas as pd

def find_filtered_closures(suspected_closures):
    filtered_closures = pd.DataFrame(columns=['FAC_NAME', 'ZIP_CD', 'Year'])
    counts = suspected_closures.groupby(['ZIP_CD', 'Year']).size().unstack(fill_value=0)
    kept_zip_codes = set(counts.index)  # Start with all zip codes
    

    for ZIP_CD in counts.index:
        if 2016 in counts.columns and 2017 in counts.columns:
            if counts.loc[ZIP_CD, 2016] == counts.loc[ZIP_CD, 2017]:
                kept_zip_codes.discard(ZIP_CD)  

        if 2017 in counts.columns and 2018 in counts.columns:
            if counts.loc[ZIP_CD, 2017] == counts.loc[ZIP_CD, 2018]:
                kept_zip_codes.discard(ZIP_CD)  

        if 2018 in counts.columns and 2019 in counts.columns:
            if counts.loc[ZIP_CD, 2018] == counts.loc[ZIP_CD, 2019]:
                kept_zip_codes.discard(ZIP_CD)  


    for ZIP_CD in kept_zip_codes:
        for Year in range(2016, 2020):
            if ZIP_CD in counts.index and Year in counts.columns and counts.loc[ZIP_CD, Year] > 0:
                fac_in_zip = suspected_closures[
                    (suspected_closures['ZIP_CD'] == ZIP_CD) & 
                    (suspected_closures['Year'] == Year)
                ]

                for index, row in fac_in_zip.iterrows():
                    new_entry = pd.DataFrame({
                        'FAC_NAME': [row['FAC_NAME']],
                        'ZIP_CD': [ZIP_CD],
                        'Year': [Year]
                    })
                    filtered_closures = pd.concat([filtered_closures, new_entry], ignore_index=True)

    return filtered_closures

filtered_closures = find_filtered_closures(suspected_closures)
print(len(filtered_closures))
```

```{python}
#groupby zip and year first then look at observations in zip per year, want count of observations

#then map it to fac names on zip code and year, keeping only the ones that did decrease. For example: BEHAVIORAL HEALTHCARE CENTER AT CLARK supose that you found that ZIP 37040 from 2016 to 2017 did not decrease, then you would want to remove that observation since you are trying to find all the hospitals that closed and there was not a decrease for that ZIP code in 2017. in one zip code was present in 2016 or not present in 2017, it means that there was a closure. 
```

    b. How many hospitals do you have left?
      Subtracting the mergers, we have 10084 hospitals left.

```{python}
print((len(suspected_closures) - len(filtered_closures)))
```

    c. Sort and report the first 10 rows.

```{python}
print(filtered_closures.sort_values(by='FAC_NAME').head(10))
```

Calculate the number of hospitals by zipcode in 2016
```{python}

#subset to only in_Texas zipcodes
Texas_health = df_health[df_health["in_Texas"] == 1]

def by_zip(df):
  #subset for 2016
  hosp_2016 = df[df["Year"] == 2016]

  #groupby zipcode, select CMS Identification number, and 
  #return a count of the CMS ID numbers associated with
  #each Zipcode
  grouped = hosp_2016.groupby("ZIP_CD")["PRVDR_NUM"].count()

  #reset index
  grouped = grouped.reset_index()

  #save to dataframe
  df_grouped = pd.DataFrame(grouped)
  return(df_grouped)

#run on Texas_health
CMS_by_zip = by_zip(Texas_health)

print(CMS_by_zip)
```

Add the CMS Number column from the grouped df to 
the shape data
```{python}
#add an int version of ZIP_CD to CMS_by_zip
CMS_by_zip["Int_Zip"] = [int(i) for i in CMS_by_zip["ZIP_CD"]]

#convert that int version into a string
CMS_by_zip["String_Zip"] = [str(i) for i in CMS_by_zip["Int_Zip"]]

#comprehension where if ZCTA5 in String_Zip add entry into
#new column 
new_col = [i for i in shape_data["ZCTA5"].values if i in CMS_by_zip["String_Zip"].values]

newer_col = [CMS_row["PRVDR_NUM"] for index, CMS_row in CMS_by_zip.iterrows() if CMS_row["String_Zip"] in new_col]




#subsetting for shape_file ZCTA5 == String_Zip in CMS_by_zip



```

Attribution: https://realpython.com/pandas-groupby/ "Example 1". Also I asked ChatGPT
why my new_col list comprehension wasn't working, and essentially the main addition
that I have included, based on its advice, is the ".values", which helps to ensure
that the correct values are being compared, and the use of itterow().
