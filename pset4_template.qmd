**PS4:** Due Sat Nov 2 at 5:00PM Central. Worth 100 points. 
We use (`*`) to indicate a problem that we think might be time consuming. 
    
## Style Points (10 pts) 
Please refer to the minilesson on code style
**[here](https://uchicago.zoom.us/rec/share/pG_wQ-pHTQrJTmqNn4rcrw5V194M2H2s-2jdy8oVhWHkd_yZt9o162IWurpA-fxU.BIQlSgZLRYctvzp-)**.

## Submission Steps (10 pts)
1. This problem set is a paired problem set.
2. Play paper, scissors, rock to determine who goes first. Call that person *Partner 1*.
    - Partner 1 (name and cnet ID):
    - Partner 2 (name and cnet ID):
3. Partner 1 will accept the `ps4` and then share the link it creates with their partner. You can only share it with one partner so you will not be able to change it after your partner has accepted. 
4. "This submission is our work alone and complies with the 30538 integrity policy." Add your initials to indicate your agreement: \*\*\_JS_\*\* \*\*\_\_\*\*
5. "I have uploaded the names of anyone else other than my partner and I worked with on the problem set **[here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/185usrCREQaUbvAXpWhChkjghdGgmAZXA3lPWpXLLsts/edit)**"  (1 point)
6. Late coins used this pset: \*\*\_1_\*\* Late coins left after submission: \*\*\_2_\*\*
7. Knit your `ps4.qmd` to an PDF file to make `ps4.pdf`, 
    * The PDF should not be more than 25 pages. Use `head()` and re-size figures when appropriate. 
8. (Partner 1): push  `ps4.qmd` and `ps4.pdf` to your github repo.
9. (Partner 1): submit `ps4.pdf` via Gradescope. Add your partner on Gradescope.
10. (Partner 1): tag your submission in Gradescope

**Important:** Repositories are for tracking code. **Do not commit the data or shapefiles to your repo.** The best way to do this is with `.gitignore`, which we have covered in class. If you do accidentally commit the data, Github has a [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github#removing-files-from-a-repositorys-history). The best course of action depends on whether you have pushed yet. This also means that both partners will have to download the initial raw data and any data cleaning code will need to be re-run on both partners' computers.

## Identify hospital closures in POS file (15 pts) (*)

1. Create a list of all hospitals that were active in 2016 that were suspected to have closed by 2019. Record the facility name and zip of each hospital as well as the year of suspected closure. How many hospitals fit in this definition?

3,130 hospitals fit this definition, out of over 7000 total hospitals.

```{python}
active_2016 = df_health[(df_health['PGM_TRMNTN_CD'] == 0) & (df_health['Year'] == 2016)]

def find_suspected_closures(active_2016, df_health):
    suspected_closures = []
    active_facilities = set(active_2016['FAC_NAME'])

    for year in range(2017, 2020):
        closed_facilities = df_health[(df_health['Year'] == year) & (df_health['PGM_TRMNTN_CD'] != 0)]

        for facility in active_facilities:
            if facility not in closed_facilities['FAC_NAME'].values:
                suspected_closures.append({
                    'FAC_NAME': facility,
                    'ZIP_CD': active_2016.loc[active_2016['FAC_NAME'] == facility, 'ZIP_CD'].values[0],
                    'Year': year
                })
    return pd.DataFrame(suspected_closures)

suspected_closures = find_suspected_closures(active_2016, df_health)
print(len(suspected_closures.loc[suspected_closures.groupby('FAC_NAME')['Year'].idxmin()]))
```

2. Sort this list of hospitals by name and report the names and year of suspected closure for the first 10 rows.

```{python}
print(suspected_closures.loc[suspected_closures.groupby('FAC_NAME')['Year'].idxmin()].sort_values('FAC_NAME')[['FAC_NAME', 'Year']].head(10))
```

3. Not all closures are true closures, remove any suspected closures that are zipcodes where the number does not decrease in the year after the suspected closure.

    a. Among the suspected closures, how many hospitals fit this definition? After correcting, how many do you have left?

    Working with the definition given, we have 3090 mergers/acquisitions.

```{python}
total_closures = suspected_closures.loc[suspected_closures.groupby('FAC_NAME')['Year'].idxmin()].sort_values('FAC_NAME')[['FAC_NAME', 'Year']]
zip_counts = suspected_closures.groupby(['ZIP_CD', 'Year']).size().reset_index(name='Observation_Count')

zip_counts = zip_counts.sort_values(['ZIP_CD', 'Year'])

zip_counts['Prev_Observation_Count'] = zip_counts.groupby('ZIP_CD')['Observation_Count'].shift(1)
zip_counts['Change'] = zip_counts['Observation_Count'] - zip_counts['Prev_Observation_Count']

#Filter for ZIP codes with no decrease or no disappearance
no_decrease = zip_counts[(zip_counts['Change'] >= 0) | (zip_counts['Prev_Observation_Count'].notnull())]

result = no_decrease[['ZIP_CD', 'Year', 'Observation_Count']]
print(result)

merged_results = pd.merge(suspected_closures, no_decrease, on='ZIP_CD', how='inner')
mergers = merged_results[['FAC_NAME']].drop_duplicates()
print(len(mergers))
```

    b. How many hospitals do you have left?
      Subtracting the mergers, we have 40 hospitals left.

```{python}
print((len(total_closures) - len(mergers)))
```

    c. Sort and report the first 10 rows.

```{python}
print(mergers.sort_values(by='FAC_NAME').head(10))
```

Restrict shape_data only to Texas zip codes

First create a list of Texas zipcodes
```{python}

#generate list of Texas zipcode leading numbers
Tex_zip_list = np.linspace(start = 750, stop = 799, num = 50).astype(np.int32)
#turn to list object
Tex_zip_list = list(Tex_zip_list)

#add Austin entry to Tex_zip_list
Tex_zip_list.append(733)

string_Tex_list = str(Tex_zip_list)
```

This function is used only for checking
zipcodes
```{python}
#make a function to pull out the first 3 letters in the 
#string for each entry 
def string_puller(df):
  #a receiver for the values
  my_strings = []
  #subset for the relevant column
  A = df["ZCTA5"]
  for i in A:
    #select the first 3 characters in each zipcode
    my_strings.append(i[0:3])
  return(my_strings)
```

Create a column for being in Texas
```{python}
#create a binary variable for in or outside of Texas
def in_Texas(df, condition):
  Texas = []
  for i in df[condition]:
    #select the first 3 characters in each zipcode
    #if they have a match in the zip code list
    #they are in Texas
    if i[0:3] in string_Tex_list:
      Texas.append(1)
    else:
      Texas.append(0)
  df["in_Texas"] = Texas
  return(df)
    
#run function on shape_data
in_Texas(shape_data, "ZCTA5")
```

Restrict shape_data to in_Texas
```{python}
Tex_shape = shape_data[shape_data["in_Texas"] == 1]

```

#convert ZIP_CD to string
df_health["ZIP_CD"] = df_health["ZIP_CD"].astype(str)
```

Use function from earlier to subset df_health to in_Texas
```{python}

  #return a count of the CMS ID numbers associated with
  #each Zipcode
  grouped = hosp_2016.groupby("ZIP_CD")["PRVDR_NUM"].count()

  #reset index
  grouped = grouped.reset_index()

  #save to dataframe
  df_grouped = pd.DataFrame(grouped)
  return(df_grouped)

#run on Tex_health
CMS_by_zip = by_zip(Tex_health)

print(CMS_by_zip)

I also asked ChatGPT how to use the code suggested in the article above. 


## Calculate zip code’s distance to the nearest hospital (20 pts) (*)

1. Create a GeoDataFrame for the centroid of each zip code nationally:
zips_all_centroids. What are the dimensions of the resulting GeoDataFrame and what do each of the columns mean?

The dimensions of the dataframe are 33120,6. And the columns are printed. For the columns, GEO_ID is the unqiue identifier for a geographic area and serves as the primary key for joining with other datasets. ZCTAS is the Zip Code Tabulation Area, NAME is the name typically associated with the zip. LSAD stands for Legal/Statistical Area Description which indicates the type of area the zip represents (so incorported, unincorporated, etc). CENSUSAREA represents the area size of the zip code region, usually measured in miles or kilometers and provides informations about the geographic extent of the area. The geometry column contains the geometric representation of the zip code area, holding the acutal shape and boundaries of the zip as a geometric object.

```{python}
zips_all = gpd.read_file('/Users/justinesilverstein/Desktop/problem-set-4-andrew-justine/gz_2010_us_860_00_500k.shp')

zips_all_centroids = zips_all.copy()
zips_all_centroids['geometry'] = zips_all_centroids.geometry.centroid

print(zips_all_centroids.shape)
print(zips_all_centroids.columns) 
```

2. Create two GeoDataFrames as subsets of zips_all_centroids. First,
create all zip codes in Texas: zips_texas_centroids. Then, create all zip codes in Texas or a bordering state: zips_texas_borderstates_centroids, using the zip code prefixes to make these subsets. How many unique zip codes are in each of these subsets? 

There are 402 uniqie zip codes in Texas and 1314 unique zip codes in it's bordering states.

```{python}
zips_all_centroids = gpd.read_file('/Users/justinesilverstein/Desktop/problem-set-4-andrew-justine/gz_2010_us_860_00_500k.shp')
zips_texas_centroids = zips_all_centroids[zips_all_centroids['ZCTA5'].str.startswith('75')]

unique_texas_zip_codes = zips_texas_centroids['ZCTA5'].nunique()
print(f"Unique ZIP codes in Texas: {unique_texas_zip_codes}")

bordering_states_prefixes = ['87', '73', '72', '70']
zips_texas_borderstates_centroids = zips_all_centroids[
    zips_all_centroids['ZCTA5'].str.startswith(tuple(bordering_states_prefixes))
]

unique_bordering_zip_codes = zips_texas_borderstates_centroids['ZCTA5'].nunique()
print(f"Unique ZIP codes in Texas and bordering states: {unique_bordering_zip_codes}")
```

3. Then create a subset of zips_texas_borderstates_centroids that contains only the zip codes with at least 1 hospital in 2016. Call the resulting GeoDataFrame zips_withhospital_centroids What kind of merge did you decide to do, and what variable are you merging on?

I first changed the column names to match and then inner merged on the variable ZIP_CD.

```{python}
hospital_zip_codes = active_2016['ZIP_CD'].unique()
hospital_zip_df = pd.DataFrame({'ZIP_CD': hospital_zip_codes})

zips_texas_borderstates_centroids = zips_texas_borderstates_centroids.rename(columns={'ZCTA5': 'ZIP_CD'})

zips_withhospital_centroids = zips_texas_borderstates_centroids.merge(
    hospital_zip_df, on='ZIP_CD', how='inner')

print(f'Number of ZIP codes with at least one hospital in 2016: {len(zips_withhospital_centroids)}')
```

4. For each zip code in zips_texas_centroids, calculate the distance to the
nearest zip code with at least one hospital in zips_withhospital_centroids.

```{python}
import time

subset_texas_zips = zips_texas_centroids.sample(n=10, random_state=1) 
start_time = time.time()
subset_texas_zips['Nearest_Hospital_Distance'] = calculate_nearest_hospital_distance(subset_texas_zips, zips_withhospital_centroids)
end_time = time.time()

print(subset_texas_zips[['ZCTA5', 'Nearest_Hospital_Distance']])
print(f'Time taken for subset calculation: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds')

```

    a.This is a computationally-intensive join. Before attempting to do the entire join, subset to 10 zip codes in zips_texas_centroids and try the join. How long did it take? Approximately how long do you estimate the entire procedure will take?

    It took 8.52 seconds to compute for 10 zip codes. I think it will take roughly 150 seconds for the entire procedure to complete. 

```{python}
zips_texas_centroids = zips_texas_centroids.to_crs(zips_withhospital_centroids.crs)

def calculate_nearest_hospital_distance(texas_zips, hospital_zips):
    distances = []
    for _, tex_zip in texas_zips.iterrows():
        distance_series = hospital_zips.geometry.distance(tex_zip.geometry)
        min_distance = distance_series.min()
        distances.append(min_distance)
    return distances

start_time = time.time()
zips_texas_centroids['Nearest_Hospital_Distance'] = calculate_nearest_hospital_distance(zips_texas_centroids, zips_withhospital_centroids)
end_time = time.time()

print(zips_texas_centroids[['ZCTA5', 'Nearest_Hospital_Distance']])
print(f'Time taken for distance calculation: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds')
```

    b. Now try doing the full calculation and time how long it takes. How close is it to your estimation?

    It took 386.52 seconds to do the whole calculation, which was very far from my estimate.

5. Calculate the average distance to the nearest hospital for each zip code in Texas.

    a. What unit is this in?
    Since we are using geometry distance, it is originally in units or degrees which are not useful for our purposes to gauge distance.

 ```{python}
# Convert the nearest hospital distances from meters to miles
zips_texas_centroids['Nearest_Hospital_Distance_Miles'] = zips_texas_centroids['Nearest_Hospital_Distance']

average_distance_miles = zips_texas_centroids['Nearest_Hospital_Distance_Miles'].mean()

print(f"Average distance to the nearest hospital for each ZIP code in Texas: {average_distance_miles:.2f} miles")
```

    b. Report the average distance in miles. Does this value make sense?

    This value does make sense as all distance in the US is measured in miles. 

```{python}
# Convert the nearest hospital distances from meters to miles
zips_texas_centroids['Nearest_Hospital_Distance_Miles'] = zips_texas_centroids['Nearest_Hospital_Distance']

average_distance_miles = zips_texas_centroids['Nearest_Hospital_Distance_Miles'].mean()

print(f"Average distance to the nearest hospital for each ZIP code in Texas: {average_distance_miles:.2f} miles")
```

    c. Map the value for each zip code.

```{python}
import geopandas as gpd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the shapefile containing Texas ZIP codes
zips_texas = gpd.read_file('/Users/justinesilverstein/Desktop/problem-set-4-andrew-justine/gz_2010_us_860_00_500k.shp')  # Replace with your file path

# Ensure the GeoDataFrame has the correct CRS
zips_texas = zips_texas.to_crs(epsg=4269)  # Adjust if necessary

# Create a figure and axis for the plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(12, 10))

# Plot all Texas ZIP codes
zips_texas.plot(ax=ax, color='lightblue', edgecolor='black')

# Add title and labels
ax.set_title('All Texas ZIP Codes', fontsize=15)
ax.set_xlabel('Longitude', fontsize=12)
ax.set_ylabel('Latitude', fontsize=12)

# Show the plot
plt.show()

```    

## Effects of closures on access in Texas (15 pts)

1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 

## Reflecting on the exercise (10 pts) 

1.

2. Consider the way we are identifying zip codes affected by closures. How well does this reflect changes in zip-code-level access to hospitals? Can you think of some ways to improve this measure?

I think there are issues with how we code and define true closures from mergers/acquisitions. The definition itself is confusng as we compare different observations from a year to year basis but a hospital could still close even if it was a merger. Furthermore, it is unclear how we discuss what we count as a merger, especially if it gets confusing how to calculate when a merger occurred. Also, this does not take into account urban areas vs rural area where distance makes a huge difference for people.
