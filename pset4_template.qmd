**PS4:** Due Sat Nov 2 at 5:00PM Central. Worth 100 points. 
We use (`*`) to indicate a problem that we think might be time consuming. 
    
## Style Points (10 pts) 
Please refer to the minilesson on code style
**[here](https://uchicago.zoom.us/rec/share/pG_wQ-pHTQrJTmqNn4rcrw5V194M2H2s-2jdy8oVhWHkd_yZt9o162IWurpA-fxU.BIQlSgZLRYctvzp-)**.

## Submission Steps (10 pts)
1. This problem set is a paired problem set.
2. Play paper, scissors, rock to determine who goes first. Call that person *Partner 1*.
    - Partner 1 (name and cnet ID):
    - Partner 2 (name and cnet ID):
3. Partner 1 will accept the `ps4` and then share the link it creates with their partner. You can only share it with one partner so you will not be able to change it after your partner has accepted. 
4. "This submission is our work alone and complies with the 30538 integrity policy." Add your initials to indicate your agreement: \*\*\_\_\*\* \*\*\_\_\*\*
5. "I have uploaded the names of anyone else other than my partner and I worked with on the problem set **[here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/185usrCREQaUbvAXpWhChkjghdGgmAZXA3lPWpXLLsts/edit)**"  (1 point)
6. Late coins used this pset: \*\*\_\_\*\* Late coins left after submission: \*\*\_\_\*\*
7. Knit your `ps4.qmd` to an PDF file to make `ps4.pdf`, 
    * The PDF should not be more than 25 pages. Use `head()` and re-size figures when appropriate. 
8. (Partner 1): push  `ps4.qmd` and `ps4.pdf` to your github repo.
9. (Partner 1): submit `ps4.pdf` via Gradescope. Add your partner on Gradescope.
10. (Partner 1): tag your submission in Gradescope

**Important:** Repositories are for tracking code. **Do not commit the data or shapefiles to your repo.** The best way to do this is with `.gitignore`, which we have covered in class. If you do accidentally commit the data, Github has a [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github#removing-files-from-a-repositorys-history). The best course of action depends on whether you have pushed yet. This also means that both partners will have to download the initial raw data and any data cleaning code will need to be re-run on both partners' computers.

```

Attribution: I asked ChatGPT how to solve the unicode errors I 
was encountering, and I was advised to try out different
encodings, including "ISO-8859-1".

Q1 Answer:

variables_list = health16.columns

print("These are the variables I selected: ", variables_list)

Function for subsetting the datasets to short term hospitals
```{python}
def short_term(X):
  Y = X[(X["PRVDR_CTGRY_SBTYP_CD"] == 1) & (X["PRVDR_CTGRY_CD"] == 1)]
  return(Y)

```

Run function on health16
```{python}
short16 = short_term(health16)

print("There are ", len(short16), " hospitals in this dataset")
```

    a.
    b.
3. 

short term function on health17
```{python}
short17 = short_term(health17)

```

short term function on health18
```{python}
short18 = short_term(health18)

```

```{python}
short19 = short_term(health19)

```

Appending the data together
```{python}
# add a "year" column to each dataset, for future disagg
def add_column(X, the_year):
  year_col = []
  i = 0
  while i < len(X):
    year_col.append(the_year)
    i += 1
  X["Year"] = year_col
  return(X)

#run on each dataframe
add_column(short16, 2016)

add_column(short17, 2017)

add_column(short18, 2018)

add_column(short19, 2019)
```

Attribution: I asked my code why my len(X) and length of index
values were not equal, and was advised to set i equal to 0 
instead of 1. 

Concat the dataframes together
```{python}

concat_1 = pd.concat([short16, short17], axis = 0, ignore_index = True)

concat_2 = pd.concat([concat_1, short18], axis = 0, ignore_index = True)

df_health = pd.concat([concat_2, short19], axis = 0, ignore_index = True)

```

Adding an observation variable to the dataframe
```{python}
def  one_dummy(C):
  observation = []
  i = 0
  while 1 > 0 and i < C:
    observation.append(1)
    i += 1
  return(observation)

#add observation column to df
df_health["Observation"] = one_dummy(len(df_health))

```

Graph observations by year
```{python}
alt.data_transformers.enable("vegafusion")

alt.Chart(df_health).mark_bar().encode(
  alt.X("Year:N"),
  alt.Y("sum(Observation)")
)


```

4.

```{python}
# create a function to iterate through PRVDR_NUM 
def unique_comp(column):
  unique_box = []
  for entry in column:
    if entry not in unique_box:
      unique_box.append(entry)
    else:
      pass
  return(unique_box)

#save list
unique_list = unique_comp(df_health["PRVDR_NUM"])

```

Filter by year in order to make numbers for each year, save those numbers to a df
```{python}
# make series with the four years
the_years = [2016, 2017, 2018, 2019]

#2016
unique_len_16 = len(unique_comp(df_health["PRVDR_NUM"][df_health["Year"] == 2016]))

#2017
unique_len_17 = len(unique_comp(df_health["PRVDR_NUM"][df_health["Year"] == 2017]))

#2018
unique_len_18 = len(unique_comp(df_health["PRVDR_NUM"][df_health["Year"] == 2018]))

#2019
unique_len_19 = len(unique_comp(df_health["PRVDR_NUM"][df_health["Year"] == 2019]))

# make the lens into a list
len_list = [unique_len_16, unique_len_17, unique_len_18, unique_len_19]

#form into dataframe

the_data = {
  "Years": the_years,
   "Unique_CMS": len_list 
}

df_CMS = pd.DataFrame(the_data)

```

Plot the graph
```{python}
alt.Chart(df_CMS).mark_bar().encode(
  alt.X("Years:N"),
  alt.Y("Unique_CMS")
)

## Download Census zip code shapefile (10 pt) 



1. 
    a. The five file types in this download are .dbf files, .prj files,
     .shp files, .shx files, and .xml file. .dbf Files have attribute information,
     .shp files have feature geometrics, and .shx files contain a positional index,
     while .prj files describe the Coordinate Reference System and .xml files 
     are used to store data in hierarchical categories. 

     Attribution: in-class lecture and https://blog.hubspot.com/website/what-is-xml-file 

    b. In terms of uncompressed
     sizes, the largest files are the .shp and .dbf files, at 817,915 and 6,275 KB, 
     followed by the .shx and .xml files at 259 and 16 KB. Coming in last is the 
     .prj file at 1 KB.




2. 

Read the data into GeoDataFrame
```{python}
#read the .shp file in
the_path = "C:/Users/andre/Documents/GitHub/problem-set-4-andrew-justine/gz_2010_us_860_00_500k.shp"

shape_data = gpd.read_file(the_path)

Restrict only to Texas zip codes
```{python}

#generate list of Texas zipcode leading numbers
Tex_zip_list = np.linspace(start = 750, stop = 799, num = 50).astype(np.int32)
#turn to list object
Tex_zip_list = list(Tex_zip_list)

#add Austin entry to Tex_zip_list
Tex_zip_list.append(733)

string_Tex_list = str(Tex_zip_list)
```

This function is used only for checking
zipcodes
```{python}
#make a function to pull out the first 3 letters in the 
#string for each entry 
def string_puller(df):
  #a receiver for the values
  my_strings = []
  #subset for the relevant column
  A = df["ZCTA5"]
  for i in A:
    #select the first 3 characters in each zipcode
    my_strings.append(i[0:3])
  return(my_strings)
```


```{python}
#create a binary variable for in or outside of Texas
def in_Texas(df):
  Texas = []
  for i in df["ZCTA5"]:
    #select the first 3 characters in each zipcode
    #if they have a match in the zip code list
    #they are in Texas
    if i[0:3] in string_Tex_list:
      Texas.append(1)
    else:
      Texas.append(0)
  df["in_Texas"] = Texas
  return(df)
    
#run function on shape_data
in_Texas(shape_data)
